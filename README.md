# Quantum Computing 🚀🔬
This repository explores quantum algorithms. Currently, it includes implementations of:

* **Bernstein-Vazirani 🏹:** A quantum algorithm that efficiently determines a hidden bitstring with a single query.

* **QPE (Quantum Phase Estimation) 🌀:** A fundamental quantum algorithm that extracts the phase introduced by a unitary operator using controlled gates and the Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT).

* **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) Implementation 🔬:** A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating ground states of quantum systems (work in progress).

📌 More algorithms and quantum experiments will be added in the future. Contributions and suggestions are welcome! 🚀
